========================================================================================

There she is, My golden wife!
Glamorously waiting in rain for my kiss,
which finally helps us breath freely again;
Her absence is mean, a horrible miss,
that can't describe the jealous pain, but...

There she is, My promise in life!
Gloriously wanting at home my return,
which finally fills her obedient heart from above;
Her smile 's I need; been told it's my turn,
To care for my love like a precious dove, but...

There she is, My support, My house!
In her loving arms I've found my place,
which has room enough for four pretty souls,
Her respect for me on her lovely face,
My hard working wife toward collective goals, but...

There she is, she is all that I want

in

the end

========================================================================================

When loneliness almost darkened my soul,
And you were behind the the game;
That friendship has come to accompany me,
make me
I suddenly see bright candle flame;
In her happiness and game I want to enroll.

When love finally hit me in the head,
And you were behind the blow, I knew;
That happiness had come to wake me,
shake me
I suddenly see the color blue;
"I love you" with soothing voice she said.

When her beauty finally reached my eye
And you were my love, my queen;
That madness had come to call me,
break me
I suddenly see the color green;
The day has come I was ready to die.

When the knife finally cut my wrist,
And blood flowed like a river gone mad;
That sadness had come to frighten me,
kill me
I suddenly see the color red;
Her longing lips near my face and kissed.

When God finally made it into my heart,
And you were behind our pray;
That understanding has come to calm me,
love me
I suddenly see the color grey;
I trust my love and I will never part

When wrong doing finally hit me in the head,
And you are in a marriage not ours;
That respect has come to teach me His,
calm me
I now see the colors of many flowers;
"I want to be your friend" with loving voice she said
And sealed our friendship with a kiss

========================================================================================

I know I have done a horrible thing and it was not my intention to hurt you or shock you in any way. I was surprised by it myself, but I did it out of love for you. I was so in panic and fear I'd lose you the will to live was totally gone. What fears me now the most is that when I did it I felt no pain or regret. Now after a few days in hospital with my stupid wounds and lots of time to think I do regret it so much. I wonder how I got it into my mind of leaving you, the thought alone of losing could stop my heart and bring tears to my eyes. In short, I lost my mind. I'm sorry if I hurt you by doing what I did, again please forgive me for that.

I cannot describe how important you are to me, you know me the best of all people I know because I have no problem being open with you about my feelings, even feelings of anger. I never felt such deep feelings for someone as I feel for you. I have so much fun with you texting or talking in skype, I feel like writing a poem for you everyday.

Leanne, no matter who you talk to or what they say to you, never ever let them talk you into breaking off contact between us. That is so wrong and so unfair in so many ways I cannot explain. We are all adults and although I know you are in a legit marriage with children and we all have our opinions and wishes, what we have is precious and should not be destroyed by a wish of somebody else but you or me.

Even I know as a not fully christian that in the eyes of God were are doing nothing wrong. I pray to God that I might meet you one day and hold you in my arms, but even when that never would happen I would always want to be in close contact with you. I need you and if I may speak on behalf of you, I think you need me too. You are not only the women I love, you are also my best friend in life.

========================================================================================

God.

Please promise me you plant my love in Leanne's heart, you know that's the only right place. Make sure she is safe. Make sure she is happy. I have no other wish, so do this for me. Give her and her kids what they want in life, they deserve it. Give Leanne the love she wants, give her kids the love they need.

You know I'm a selfish man but hear me out. I love her and I never want to lose her. If I ever put my trust in you it would be that you connect our hearts. I have been putting Leanne in a difficult situation and blame me, not her. Make sure she has the happiest life you can imagine. Do that for me, and I will trust you.

Amen

========================================================================================

God,

Please promise me to tell Leanne that our friendship is something I cannot live without. I already lost a wife, a lover, a daughter, don't let me lose her friendship too. Please make sure she and her kids are safe and happy.


========================================================================================

Hello Richard,

I'm writing to you because I thought it might be time I gave some explanation on what happened and tell you how I feel and think about things. I do hope you are willing to read my message. I also want to be completely honest with you, even when I sound horrible to you. Now things are in the open it is best to talk open. Leanne told me you would accept my message. If I was able to I would tell you this in person, but I can't.

Leanne and I got to know each other playing Dice on the phone. We started talking and I thought it was great, she being from Canada and I used to work here in Holland for a Canadian company Air Transat. We talked just chit chat nothing special.

After some time I started to develop feelings for Leanne. I knew she was married with children but it happened anyway. I told her about it and she was flattered. Still she said to me that it could never possibly work, she was married and she broke our contact.

I can't remember exactly but after some time we started talking again and again I expressed my feelings to her. This time she told me she had the same feelings for me. We talked about our feelings for weeks, we were deeply in love. We talked about she would come to Holland or I would come to Canada, we even looked up houses where we wanted to live. We even talked about having a child.

In one of our last Skype talks she told me that she was struggling with her situation. She told me that she never really loved you, well as I understood it, not liked she loved me. She was afraid of your reaction, her friends and family talking into her to forget about our love. I told her that it would be best to tell you about it. Somehow the truth always comes up.

Well, I believe she has told you and it looks like we are in a difficult situation.

Things has changed though. Leanne still loves me but wants to repair her marriage with you. That broke my heart of course but I cannot do something else then respect that. I have no doubt that Leanne told you about my personal troubles. I don't want to bore you with that but my world crashed a little.

I told Leanne not long ago that she is not only the women I love, she is also my best friend. I know you would like to see that Leanne and I never have contact again, but since I am working hard on respecting your marriage, I want to stay in contact with Leanne as a friend. To be honest I really need that. This might sound horrible to you but I still love her and I can't bare the thought of losing her again, this time as a friend.

Our contact is just telling each other about our lives, work, exchanging bible verses, pray together or sending each other songs to listen too. We still play a game of Dice or Trivia sometimes. Since Leanne told me she wants to go for her marriage our contact has changed more into a friendship relation, something I value a lot and again to be honest cannot do without.

I'm sorry this all has happened and maybe we, or at least I, should have told you much earlier but I can't change the past.

I promise I will respect your marriage if you respect my friendship with Leanne.

I don't expect an answer but if you want you are more then welcome to respond.

I'm open if you have questions, I will answer them truthfully.

I hope you realize that I know this difficult for you too.

May God walk with you,

Olaf

Field of joy

I woke up in a field of joy
My lover waits for me oh boy!
I plucked a hand full daisies there,
my lover will braid in her golden hair.

I walked and talked and felt so good
Until I saw a pointy blue hood!
Could it be my lover so sweet,
that I may finally lay down at her feet.

We looked we felt we touched we held
Oh all the lonely days we quelled!
The sun poured love into our hearts,
we were the victims of Cupid's darts.

We kissed until we fell asleep
I dreamed so sweet she's mine to keep!
I woke up in a field of joy,
she is my girl, am I her boy?

We lived so happy God blessed our love
I thanked Him everyday for my dove!
He heard my prayers and then He smiled
and 9 months later we were blessed with a child.

We felt so good we had no fear
I kept her always near and dear!
Excellent lovers and always best friends,
and this is why true love never ends.


========================================================================================

Statue

The foundation I need needs time to evolve
I am a clock that waits our lovin'
When reasons to resist they did dissolve
Touchin' and rubbin' and kissin' and huggin'

The marble I need needs tender beating
I am a wave that sets you free
When it's so quiet I can hear you breathin'
Like some dark marvel close with the sea.

The rock I need needs a confession
I am the moist for us to grow
When tenderness sleeps at night as a question
And, like its own Seas, only Ebbs to flow.

The mountain I need needs hope and thinkin'
I am a bird with broken wings
In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
When loneliness wakes me none but an angel sings.

The fortune I need needs light and air
I am the reader that reads your thoughts
For now of nothing may our state despair
Occupying my bones envy slowly rots.

The statue I need needs love and condone
I am a fool to resist the sea
Your virtue raynes as Queen in royal throne
As I'm clinging on to, but drowning, Gods tree

The wisdom I need needs a body so fair
I am the sculptor who knows his lover
And therewith doe her cruelty compare
'cause for me, 'cause for me there will be no other.

The woman I need needs hands of desire
I am the one who feels her pain?
But when the anthem shakes the choir
Are they singing our love in vain?

========================================================================================

Questions

In my my mind you are here, but still I ask
Where you are when I'm hand in hand with the dark
As if I don't trust my dreams, your task at last

My fingers and close my arms in an arc
Could it be that I mistaken, your so close at most
Too short like the Gospel according to Mark

The summer is coming to call the lark
I put myself to shame, the elders should condemn me
My body in posture of question mark

I put myself in your hands and legs
For as I have no questions anymore
Walking with God, for consciousness just begs

At the turning of the year and still rebellious
What are my answers for the crowed?
And she don't mind hangin' out with the fellas

I wished to hang on a roman cross

========================================================================================

kiera


What a mothers wish, a fairytale,
I don't care whose kid it is you carry:
I knew her name was Ariel

Oh boy it ain't wise to idealize,
So when you appeared they had no idea:
I knew his name was Levi

If I had to give karma,
C'est bien la vérité le dharma:
I knew her name was Kiera

========================================================================================

Touch

Oh mighty wind accept my kiss and take it with you there where my lover dwells for I can't touch her beauty. Bring me back her smile, her voice, her story, her kisses, anything you can steal, my heart is longing and aching my hands are trembling, blow my love thru her hair. Walk with her support her feet surround her and play with her hair so that she may think I'm the one that gently strokes her cheek.

Oh fearless sun reveal my deepest thoughts to her, connect us by your light this should leave some print to prove her spirit-kisses real. Let her rest in your gloom, massage her soul into sleep, send your photons back and forward into our entanglement that only true love can endure.

Oh endless spirit give me news from deep within her heart, show me that place where I have touched, my new home where her everlasting love is my bed, her kisses my clothes, her beauty my peace, her smile my food. Melt our wanting bodies in one for I have to be sure that our touch remains in the hands of you who knows the needing and meaning of two lovers minds.

Oh inpatient time slow down your clock give us moments in units of years so that I can feel her warmth that I need as a river needs the sea. Grant our pulsating lips, her longing hips a future for my hands in discover. Lay down your need for aging so fast, our senses need time for I've been craving for her touch.

========================================================================================

Oh spring! Light the tulip lanterns and hum your pretty tune!
Bring me my love from the virginal woods,
it is time she leaves her cocoon!

Oh spring! Wake up the larks and sprinkle the hills
A trace of dew on my lovers lips,
relieve us of customs, old constraints, and narrow ills.

Oh spring! Show me green cornfields and a warm breeze on her face!
Melt the lingering ice for the flowers to grow,
Show me roses I gather for my lover, she's my support, my vase.

Oh spring! Hurry up like the wind, name your fruits from the tree!
I need to pluck my lover so bad,
She is my spring, my life, my beloved ruby.

Oh spring! Give us green pastures as far as the eye can see!
My love needs a bed to lay down her head,
She humming for my love like a bumble bee.

Oh spring! Start new life in your joy and warm up all the eggs!
then I drift away on your lovely day where the wildflowers bloom,
I smell her perfume and finally rest myself between my Princess' legs.

========================================================================================

Dear god,

I hope you send me away soon in your lovely hell
I can't wait, I hope to meet some people there
All you have done is bring me pain and suffering
Burnt silver brushed lavender offspring.

Fuck up all the kids in Africa for all I care,
Nor come to barstardise the kids you bear
An' why we done it is our own affair
As if the church had another wife to spare?

Cast away your lies and thruth for its not true
When you called upon me for my lover I was in the wrong queue
And therefore I will never again talk with you
How shall we all lament! Fake god: Adieu.

========================================================================================

Dear God,

Forgive my bad thoughts, I blame you for not having the love of my life,
And I always will blame you. Show me the reason, if not we will fight forever!

You know need I need her, she needs me, I need her, you need her, she needs you!
So I don't see the problem you give me. Give me solutions, you are the creator?

Sometimes I feel so lost, missing her, why oh why? I feel so sad,
Sometimes you tell me to do the best thing, but I won't!
I cant leave her, never God, she is my life, my heart, my blood
I just miss her so. So why don't you give me to me? Whats your problem with me?

I always asked you to protect her and give her kids what they need, I think I give her what she need?
We will keep having problems if we don't come up with solutions, you know that.
I try with all that I have to trust you but you keep me in tears!
Stop that I'm having problems with the tears. I want to be happy with Leanne.

So give me a break will you? I have so many dreams about Leanne and me I can tell you about.
Give Leanne what she wants, give her kids what they want. Protect her when I can't because she is me.

Amen

========================================================================================

Kiss in May

Shall I compare you to a summer's day?
Nature is ready love so embrace me today.
No more rough winds as I kiss you in May,
And summer will never ever fade away.
Whenever I see you you shine so bright,
Sweet as a breeze and tasty like Turkish delight.
As long as we live and see our lust,
There will be a summer in where we can trust.
Under the sun we will breath and come near.
For God has blessed us His message is clear,
He brought us the summer in where we will lay,
That beautiful morning when we kissed in May.

========================================================================================

Love of ages

As I stare amazed in your open mouth!
your aching body waits for my steaming hot body,
to be pinned under mine, as I touch you south:
Then suddenly so wet, so willingly soggy.

There is no stopping this frantic loving!
I pull you close I want you hard,
For two bodies in anger and wanting I'm hunting:
Would you make it easy, would you make me hard?

Kiss my rod, kis my neck, kiss my arms, be with me!
Stand up and show me your arms behind your back,
I need you firm as strong as myrrh tree:
follow my inpatient serpents orgasms attack.

Come here now and kiss me, let me grab your hips!
Feel my seamen go into you, don't fight my urge,
I taste the salt you spray on my lips:
In the depths of your belly I want to submerge.

Your hands on my bottom as I explore you within
Scratching my back as you reach your highest high
Your voice in my ear saying that you've never been
I kissed you and held you and told you: it is I

Next morning I watched you such beauty is mine!
Your breathing so gentle, I gave you my life,
I whisper oh so softly: wilt thou be mine?
You woke up and smiled and said: I Am your wife.

========================================================================================

Sunrise on the ocean
Portugal holiday


I was lonely in Porta and desperate forlorn,
a silent 'eu te amo' filled my silent cold chest:
While youth and beauty made a hot summer nights morn,
As though an infant's finger had touch'd my breast.

I was waiting your presence on our private beach,
ordered the ocean awaits my lovers sweet song:
I did heard the mermaids singing too    , each to each,
My waiting for her made the hours twice long.

Then lastly I saw her, she kissed the sea,
So close to God and with golden smooth voice:
'Welcome my love', she did say to me,
And I had no choice but to fall on my knee.

That evening repeated as long as we dreamed,
Our kisses like honey so full and so real:
'Rip down all sadness!' I beastly screamed,
when I saw your heart, love was all I could feel.

Your blow from the mouth whispered truthful emotion,
'I never will leave you, trust me, oh my dear!':
I thanked Him for taking away my only hearts fear,
as we watched the sun drown in the blue ocean.

========================================================================================

Dear Lord,

Please hold the hand of my girl. She needs you and she needs me, I feel that. Walk with her so she sees me for what I am. I'm done with asking you but give me whats right. Make me happy, make her happy let her feel our love. I read your words in the bible and try to understand. How must I make you understand Leanne is mine? How do I changes such difficult things? A little help would be nice.

Give me a sign that I can work with, give Leanne the warmth in her heart she so longs for. Make sure her benjamin is happy I love her, make sure her boy gets well, make sure her young lady lives life.

Fine, I won't lie, I try to steal her from Richard. He is a good man but I'm better. I defend myself with a love so deep for her you must feel that. Richard is a better christian then me, but my love for Leanne is of no compare. If what I say or ask makes any sense, please say something. You know that what I ask is so simple but fair.

If I was a god I would know what to do. I would give the world what she needed, give benjamin all that's she wants and fly away with my love. So maybe we could switch for a day? Perhaps you would feel what I feel when I miss my Leanne so much.

I won't stop asking you to protect her, its important she is to be safe. Let her see the art of pray, let her feel the love of touch. Let her trust in you above, let her trust in me below.

Bring my heart to her, please show me the way. I wish to be a good man. Leanne is so soft and sweet I must asked you to hold her for me. Give me a home in her heart, let us pray in your light, give right to my claim, accept our love in your dear name.

========================================================================================

Young love(rs)

As our oldest touched sixteen young springs,
in love with a reckless boy, it gave her blind wings.
Her mother was worried and couldn't let go,
She did not see her daughter slowly slowly slowly grow.

She is almost a woman but she still needs advice,
She won't stop this until you're in her near sights.
Give love room to express his tender true meaning,
All your gifts and all your peace is deceiving.

Remember the day you felt the love you gave me,
Remember the happiness we felt under myrrh tree.
So give them that same happy loving in their heart,
For as we both know love is beautiful sheer art.

The young lovers left us in search of a good life,
And I saw the loving tears on the cheeks of my wife.
I kissed them away, held her tight, showed her smile,
Hoping convincing young love is more then worthwhile.

Young couple gave birth, held their promise to God,
And mother gave her blessing with with a gentle loving nod.
We went home and searched each other in our minds,
And realized and practiced that true love really binds.

========================================================================================

God,

Its time I started to say some nice things to you instead of complaining to you. Thank you for bringing Leanne into my life. She brings me joy and makes me so happy. Thank you for making her, I do believe it was your best job creating this woman. Her smile gives me reason to think happy, her live gives me reason to live. I guess I start to see you thru her eyes. In her eyes I see love, the love I need. Give us hope, bless our love, be our guide. One day I will show you this love is worth for heaven.

Heal her spine and neck and headaches for I don't like her in pain. Give her wonderful kids the life they seek. Give my girl my love and my kiss, touch her heart for me, I am close but still not there. Watch her dreams, connect our souls. Let us meet one day under the sun.

I wonder sometimes why you put us so far apart. I feel close to her but you know what I mean. I think she knows my heart. Protect her for me, kiss her kiss her in the wind for me when she prays prays for me.

Amen

========================================================================================

God,

Last night I dreamed a dream about you and me talking. Was a good conversation. Not sure if that was really you or just my own mind. I will keep you on your promise though, have no doubt about that.

As the days go by I feel calmer and calmer, but my deep love for her remains. I don't want to deny my own feelings, not even to you. I hope you give Leanne the same. I don't want to hurt her in any way, but I learned even before knowing you true love is here to stay. Although Leanne pushes me away sometimes, and I understand why, I always hope you talk to her, show her what love is made of. I think she knows, she must know!

I turned to you not for favours or petty, but because Leanne asked me too and I love her deeply. If you call me I want it to be with love in my heart for her and knowing she loves me too.

Give her happy thoughts, give her kids joy and protection. Kiss her for me when I'm not there for her. Watch over her if I can't for she is the most precious gift in life.

Throw my frowns away, let me smile to her, make me strong again so I can kiss her on day under your sky, in your love.

Amen

========================================================================================

Kisses and tears

Oh empty old ship, are my tears not enough fluid to sail me to the harbour I call Her? Why won't you set sails we are waisting loves time! My treasure is not at the bottom of the sea but in the bottom of my chest, so away and hurry, bring me to my love, her hands awaits kissing, her lips awaits wanting. I have no luggage my heart weights a ton, for as I am so weary and lonely without her within.

Speedy dolphin show my Dolphin tell her I'm on my way! Tell her no wave can keep me from touching her shoulder. For as I'm sure to spill some tears there finally see her when my tears mix with hers on her breasts, and make a little love wave on her belly is that not our true faith? Even Poseidon is on my side and God on hers, we walk with the Gods and swim with the dolphins, the earth has blessed us.
	
Show me some islands where we can reside, I want take her away from misery and pain for she deserves all happiness I bring, an island ring will be my vow in the evening if I kiss her good night. Make me the captain I know where to go, the wind has told me where her lonely tears flow. Leave the spyglass at home her image is in my mind, you will see her cruel beauty as we hit the sand; no compare will reach your eye Gods delight.

========================================================================================

A day in the life (nederlands en engels)

Een heel gewone dag,
die gewelige lach!
wat ben je toch lief,
kom hier mijn hartedief.

Ik heb je gemist,
wil je kussen op je mond!
kom hier op mijn schoot zitten,
zie in je ogen, voel aan je kont.

Vertel me hoe is het met jou?
Waarom ben je stil wees niet flauw!
Je weet dat ik je lief heb mijn vrouw,
Ik wil met je trouwen omdat ik je vertrouw.

Hoe langer we praten hoe meer we saam zijn,
Ik vind jou zo lief en zo mooi en zo fijn!
Laten we wandelen in de nacht en bidden voor ons,
Opdat onze liefde nooit wegvloeid het voelt aan als dons.

Wist je dat ik me afvroeg maar eigenlijk voel hoe jij voelt?
Dan voel ik me dom en pak je hand voor een kus,
Als je zegt tegen mij lief: 'Ik weet wat jij bedoelt'?
Dan weet ik weer dat onze liefde is als een ingewikkelde lus.

We kletsen, we mokken, we vechten we vrijen,
Kan niet wachten tot morgen tot je volgende lach!
Als jonge geliefden elkaars lichaam bevrijen!
En ik weer mag genieten van jou en de nieuwe dag.

---

Just a normal day,
That wonderfull smile!
oh how sweet you are,
come here my beloved.

I mist you,
Wanna kiss you on the mouth!
come here and sit on my lap,
I see your eyes, I feel your butt.

Tell me now how are you today?
Why you won't tell me don't be silly!
You know that I love you my wife,
I want to marrie you because I trust you.

The more we talk the more we are closer,
I think you are sweet and beautiful and nice!
Let go for a walk in the night and pray together for us,
So that our love never flush away and feels like fluff.

Did you know that I was wondering but I do know how you feel?
I feel so stupid and give a kiss on your hand,
When you say to me dear: 'I know what you mean'
Then I know that our love is a complicated knot.

We talk, we argue, we fight and make love,
I can't wait until tomorrow and your next smile!
Like young lovers free up our bodies!
So that I can enjoy you and the new day.


========================================================================================

Dear God,

Is it normal to ask everyday like I ask? If not tell me. Today I missed Leanne so much, I even panic a little. I was not sure what to do. After I felt a little better saying to her what happened. She is such a help, I was doing fine, I hate this day. Still I'm happy she is fine and I am fine. Sometimes the words flow out of my mouth but tonight I'm not much of a writer.

I felt sooooooo great in the morning, I even text Leanne early. Not to wake her but to send her a message. I'm not going to say about today, I just like always want to ask you to look out for her, my Leanne. I write her poems and sometimes I mention you, strange enough I need Leanne to understand you. She helps a lot in that. I don't talk so much about you with her and perhaps we will do in future, I don't want that now.

She is my haven I wrote a couple of days ago and she really is. Don't change that. Writing to her helps me make me happy, and hopefully make her happy. Hope you like my crap too.

Let me love her ok? Let her love me too? She is so my light, I have no words. She is true the most beautiful person I ever met. Keep her that way, keep her safe and her kids. Asking too much again? Ok, I'll stop.

Make sure she is happy (last question)

In your love,

Amen

========================================================================================

Table linen

'I hate and I love. Why I do this, perhaps you ask.
I don't know, but I feel it happening and I'm tormented.'
But your beauty and kisses reminds your task,
when you gently make a cast of my unhealty death mask.

I watch you repair, follow thy hands handle table linen,
They say that I'm demented partitioned and fragmented.
My love for you has not yet fully been written,
When you wrap me in linen, my departure my prison.

Your soft hands warm my hands for they are so cold.
You kiss my fingertips acknoledging your love,
In your eyes I drown on your knees I find rest,
Save me! Save my words in your wooden wedding chest.

Our first meal in silence we talked with our eyes.
Our first kiss in silence I felt like a villain.
Our hands met on the virginal white clean table linen,
Your mouth made a wordless why and I yelled 'Leanne, no never goodbyes!'

But let us remember the sunny bright days alack and alas.
Did you not always felt happy when I said 'Hello?'
When we sealed our love on the reed meadow grass?
At the sight of first snow, we did know, we did know!

========================================================================================

Thunder and rain

It was on a friday I saw you late at night, wanna hold you tight!
The hours went slow had some lonely battles to fight, thats right!
I wonder how many times I wanted to misbehave, but please be brave!
The thunder was God screaming the promise He gave to me, poor wafe,
in His hands rest our love there and so pleasantly safe.

Then at last I saw you running t'wards me, around your neck our love key!
I forgot about time, you so sublime, not knowing to kiss you or climb,
Then I knew when you touched, we were never untouched, our arms clutched!
The rain was God crying our love over us, and thus He gave to us,
That we move in the light of His beauty and thus, no rush, we must, we must a kus.

I never was able to show you the tour I had planned, it could not be canned!
As I dragged you into my room, touched your womb, wept my tears over you tears gland,
Caressing and blessing your name in such shame as our eyes took the aim,
Assist me to hold you in dearest proclaim, not in shame, as you took my name,
In your body, in your soul, in your hands in our love I remain.



========================================================================================

God,

I asked Leanne to help me to find a good house, where I can talk with you about me and her. She is willing to help which is such a relieve. We talked about hearts and I know hers is good. As time goes by I feel more calm and relax. I watched her today benjamin and that gave me lots of joy. I sometimes forget that joy lives in little things, in little kids, little words. So I come to you today with little words.

Love, heart, care.

Give her that and I am a happy man. Fill her heart with love and desire its all I have and can. Be our guide, show us hope.

I never knew Leanne broke when I hurt myself, maybe I didn't want to know and I feel ashamed. You know that I never wanted to hurt her in any way. Although my stupid mistakes she is still here for me almost everyday and I want you to love her for that, give her way. Her presence and characters are so open and honest, I have never felt such love and compasion in one soul, you should mind.

Give her my feelings for you know they are real. Give her feelings to me, how long can I hate myself for the weakness conceal?

I give you my thoughts break down any thing you don't like. I want to be ready for her on my day when I'm good. Plant good things in our hearts for we want to be nice to each other and to you and to anyone else.

Amen

God my friend,

I had a funny day. I woke up fine, dreamed in english long sleep. Later when I went to the shop I had a panic attack or something. I had trouble seeing and trouble walking, I felt like I could fall anytime. When I came home I wanted to call Leanne but she was still in deep sleep. I read her poem and that calmed me down a lot. I prayed and asked why you was not with me walking today. So why not?

Today Leanne and I had a erotic moment that was full of love. We needed it, I felt so near to her, it made me smile. In spite of all, I'm glad she was honest to me about it and I love her for that. I keep telling you that she is so mooi but you already know of course.

Thank you for bringing the words in my mind when I'm writing for her, that helps so much. I read lots in the Bible app Leanne gave me. Sometimes I send her some verses I like, she likes them too. Last night I missed her pray for me but I knew she did think of me, I felt it. I love her so much, never take her away from me for we will have a big fight.

All the questions you have for me I already know the answer in my heart. All the things I do wrong I also know. Thru Leanne I want you too. You know I share these prayers with Leanne so you should pretty know all about me and my feelings. I want to go to church next week, not sure which, I have asked Leanne, she is helping me. Perhaps you don't care but I do, I want to have the feeling that I'm with her when I go there.

Love her tomorrow as you have never loved her before ok? Say to her that she is the sunshine, say to her thats she is your child. Make sure her benjamin smiles everyday and is happy give her what her little heart desires, make sure her boy has fun in his play and sports, make sure her young lady finds what she seeks. Give Richard peace.

Give us the dream we so are so longing for. In your heart and wisdom I trust.

Amen.

Wake up my love

When the first sun in morning woke me up from my dream,
I looked at her, she's still there, still asleep; such grace,
I could not resist myself and kissed her royal face,
Hoping she wouldn't notice, but she opened her eyes; I saw love there agleam.

As I stared at her mouth waiting for that lovely sound,
A softly "Good morning love" poured out over me; so fragile,
I knew that I entered her innermost temple,
I replied "Hi there my love, it is you that I've found!".

She closed her eyes again I noticed her smile,
That always gives me strength to overcome all my fears,
When I miss her the most and heartache screams in my ears,
Again I kissed her scarlet sweet lips, knowing this morning and she is worthwhile.

========================================================================================

God,

Thanks for the day Leanne and I had. I really needed her today and she was there for me. Again I did not want to tell her but I can't lie to her even if it is crap news. There is so much in my mind lately. I find rest in Leanne, I feel the need to get better every time I think of her.

She asked me to write a poem about us waking up next to each other. That was not only a poem, it was also a reminder to you to let you know I'm ok and she is my sweet morning when I wake up healthy.

I know she has to give her family lots of attention but sometimes I want to be selfsish and steal her attention just for me. I know thats wrong but you know I need her and I like to believe she needs me too.

Thank you for making our sundays more relaxed, I usually freak out on this day but its getting better every week.

As always I ask you to bless her beautiful kids they are so nice. Give us room for love so we can share our love with you.

Amen.

========================================================================================

Sex with you

As I woke up at night with fighing skills of a knight!
My body in flames oh so hard and so ready to fight!
You knew what was coming, you knew my desire!
Pin you down, take you hard, put your body on fire!

I grabbed thy hair pushing you everywhere, open up your dispair!
Lets fight, please resist I will conquer, teach you how to prepare!
Give head, open up the path to thy cave of gold and fresh moist,
As your legs are hoist, no rest! Let your orgasms be loudly long voiced!

I'm not asking! I am taking! I'm taking you on my lovers body robbery,
Hear my longing when my sword cuts you in half be my sweet quiet property!
Fight me or bite me call me knight of the dark for I will leave my true mark!
On your body when finished and I turn into a gentle lover, my sweet singing lark.

Tired and crying we slept for a while my soft lily of the nile,
And our dreams went in sync, as we walked through the columned aisle,
Where God saw us kissing and proclaiming without shaming this and His truth,
And my wish came true, on your white silky body so tender and smooth.

========================================================================================

God,

In all my ups and downs, Leanne seems to sense my feelings and really feels me. I want to thank you for that. When I was making coffee this afternoon I felt something behind me, I could swear that was Leanne. That coffee tasted better then all the coffee I had before.

After writing a love making poem for her I helped myself and had her in my erotic mind. It was beautiful and full of love. Lately when I miss her I try to daydream about all kinds of walks and talks we would have. Her voice and laughter in my mind is such a delight. I even daydream about her kids sometimes. I'm not sure if that is correct but I mean it in a good way.

Please find the time for us, time is so important for us. I need to get my life back on track so I can work on a true journey to Leanne. Give me that and give Leanne the patients to wait for me. Its all I ask I guess. I feel already so much better.

Help Leanne handle things I know its difficult for her so please walk with her. Let her know that its ok; that I am hers.

Protect her kids, make them happy and give them nice dreams. Touch her heart for me and while you are with her; give her my kiss. Let me come home to her in her heart, give us a home and give us a home in your love.

Amen

========================================================================================

Song of Leanne

My lovely Leanne let us walk and touch the earth and feel the grass.
    Where the butterflies kiss all the flowers;
    and where God has hidden a gift for us.

He told me in a dream where to find our treasure,
    when near He said you would start to kiss my hands,
    do you know my Leanne whats in there?

Do say my Leanne your heart is fully blessed with our love.
    I even taste it in our meals that you lovingly and proudly prepare;
    Coming home is coming home to you my Leanne;
    I always run the last mile for I cannot wait your sweet kiss!

For hours we spend in the fields watching nature go by.
    I carried my love Leanne when her feet needs some rest;
    She kissed my hands, we found our gift;
    It was a box with His blessing for us and our love from above.

========================================================================================

God,

First of all, thank you for today. It was great! I saw Leanne having fun and see her beautiful smile and beautiful kids. She had a great day with her girls and even I enjoyed that. Today I listened to last week sermon. In the beginning I liked it very much. Lost of talk about dreams and vision. Thats how I speak to Leanne in my poems and to you. After that it went bad and difficult. I felt the pastor was talking about her, guess you know how I felt.

I tried writing like Songs in the Bible for Leanne in a poem. Put words in your story and mouth but I have no shame! You must have done something, our love has grown more deeply, more meaningful like in the beginning. You know how it started, flirting and such and altough I want her still so much, I do feel our love has so much more feeling; our hearts are true connected. My feelings as true, her heart, mind and speak too.

I want to kiss her hand, say hello, kiss her, feel her touch, smile to her, be her husband. Give us time you won't be dissapointed. I always wondered why such a animal like me should deserve a woman like Leanne, but she is there for me and loves me and I love her so much. I never felt this way before. I feel like a king so happy in my mind!

Give her to me Jesus, my God and my friend, you know she will be safe in my arms. I would care for her like You do. Let us celebrate our love under your watchful
eyes and love. Help us, help me, help her. Give us your gift box.

Amen

========================================================================================

Empty hours

As a wolf to the moon I screamed my hollow cries,
Lonely as a pregnant cloud in the sky I feared the lies,
Oh trust! Where are you when I need you! Come now!
Search my doubts; Where is she? What to do? Tell me how!

As a sloppy old clock I can't see thru empty hours,
Let me die, let me lie with her on a bed of Gods flowers,
Oh fear! Where is she when I need her the most! My silent host!
Let me leave; You know I'm heading out to that other cold coast!

As an angry young hermit I deny my own smokey shadows,
Closed friendship, black walls of fear, scratching deep sorrows,
Oh hunger! Why don't you leave me I don't need your spell! Farewell!
All I want is my pearl, my beloved Leanne in a glimmering oyster shell!

As an old creepy drunkard I'm blind for new days,
I dwell in cold dark nights as my dark soul surveys,
Oh love! I'm so lost! Give me booze my hatched Muse,
Please don't go; Don't you know? Don't praise its awful refuse!

As a blind man I walk towards the inevitable abyss,
In search for a sign of you that I so deeply miss,
Oh Leanne! Guide me to safer greener lands, grab my lonely crippled hand!
Let us rest on Gods fields, our love, which you and Him only understand; I demand!

As an old man I remembered my empty hours of petulance on the stormy isle,
Regretting past and future, the beauty of her lips parting for that smile!
Oh resentment! Why did you enter my bleeding heart! I want no part of your smart!
For Leanne is whom I love and will always be in my silly, weakening, dying old heart.

========================================================================================

Dear God,

As you know I'm a little worried for coming weekend. I fully love and trust Leanne, I guess I'm only asking not let to be this weekend be a bridge between us so I'm unable to get to my love. I ask for myself and for Leanne. I want to say so many things about it to you and Leanne but I will not, in the hope you hear me and help us thru this. I keep searching for a way to explain and convince you that what we have is such beauty. I know myself I will come over my problems and stand strong and come for her, I need you to help my dear Leanne to wait for me a little more. She knows I love her and I am so sure she wants me and wants to be with me. Make me stronger everyday, I know I can do this and want so to show her and you my and our love.

She has given me so much hope of a happy life we talked about. I told her she made me a better man, surely you must see that. I think I made her a better woman too, she is happy and in love. If you look at her you will see that. Her smiles tell. Be gentle for her, she is my gift we talked about.

As you know I've been daydreaming a lot lately. I don't need a fancy life, I just want a happy one with her, enjoy each other, take care of her kids, not forgetting their father. As you won't tell me I don't know the future, I only know I have some influence in it. Become healty and travel for my Leanne.

Now the difficult part. She is in marriage, but loves me. Give her a new one and blame me for that. I'm trying to get to know you but if I'm right you will see that its good and Leanne and me will always thank you for that, everyday.

Give us what I sometimes describe in my poems, love, kisses, your blessing, a new life. I want to make her happy for she makes me happy and together we can make you happy.

Give her beautiful children the love in their hearts to grow up. Kiss my love for me; I miss her.

Amen

Second Song of Leanne

March was cold but warm that day,
when she sang for my 42nd year!
Dressed in red, good and gay,
I felt so happy I shed a tear!

When we talked and stared in our eyes,
my chest was pounding so hard for Leanne!
We were so happy as blue sunny skies,
She is my true wife, I am her real man.

In darker days she is here for me,
She prays for us and heals the night!
So that I always feel her near with me,
When I'm with her I am so right.

I thank the Lord for the love of my life,
And pray that one day I hold her so tight!
Love her and kiss her and call her my wife,
From that day on we're married under Gods sunlight.

I dance with her and feel her close,
Her arms around me it feels so good!
I'll never let go she is my red rose,
And God whispered: 'this love is good'.

========================================================================================

Unfinished crap

I am this little particle, light as helium and hydrogen,
That floats in mid air, waiting for loves collision.
Where my foton will emit,

========================================================================================

God,

Thank you for keeping me calm right now for I am as nervous like hell. Although Leanne has reassured me a lot she loves me and miss me you know whats in my heart and mind. I sleep for so many hours as I have only my mind. Bring me to Sunday evening or Monday soon for I can't wait to speak with her and be with her again. I fear the future, I fear losing what I love the most.

I have been daydreaming a lot. Daydreaming is for me not so much controlling dreams, more like imagining how it will be. I told her like a thousand times I'm not man who wants a fancy life. I would want a simple happy one, a life where we can enjoy the little things.

Please tell her I miss her. I hope her kids have fun too this weekend without their parents. Keep Leanne close to your heart, keep me close to her heart, keep her close to my heart. I turn to you, you are my road to Leanne; let me walk that road and find her there.

Amen

========================================================================================

My lady

Speak to me with words I never seen;
Come to me in a golden dress my silver Queen;
Hear the happy birds cry love is in us between!
I learned your soul on my shoulder serene;
Oh Father, why did you not told me, why intervene?
When we walked in arms along the seine, unseen;
Why did you burn my youth, now I'm a rotten mandarine;
Sounds like regression toward the regretful mean?

Her silk skin is all I need to write my love story on;
So all mermaids can see her eyes is all I gazed upon;
And Kings and fish never fear sharks that she'd be gone;
My eyes seen her voice when I kissed the blessed dawn;
The angels called me for a party when they saw my dear fawn;
Telling me dance with the one I love, my beloved Leanne;
Hold her don't be afraid, you are good, she is your waiting swan!

I heard all sounds, read all words, I loved many cards;
Bad when young, took it all like a bachelor of sexuall arts;
I didn't care, I wanted to be a God, what a dreadful farce!
Felt like on top of the world, proud of bleeding woman hearts;
Never cared for a girl after her stupid fluently crying starts;
Those days where filled with drinks and stolen private parts;

Now I found a lady that makes me see my own mistakes;
For years, after having regrets and lonely tears and shakes;
Showed me how I should live my life and love after sour grapes;
She fills houshold and bellies and joy with her sweet tasty cakes;
As I hope to thank and kiss her when she is in her red drapes!

========================================================================================

God,

This must be the best Sunday between Leanne and me so far. I feel she is happy, I feel her in my heart, I can tell by the way she speaks. Thank you for helping me stay calm, my mind was with her every minute. I listen to my fav music and see some nice movies. I can't imagine her not with me.

I'm sorry, no poems today, I could not for some reason. I read some bible verses that made me happy and think of Leanne but no inspiration. Maybe it was my worries. I'll try tomorrow. I'm going to talk to her face to face and that makes me so happy, I can't wait. I read Tristan und Isolde today, I like to read that.

I'm feeling overwhelmed again by her love again. Everyday I feel stronger and more secure about myself. Leanne too gives me strenght to think about our plan, find your gift. I did not go to church, also because I thought Leanne would not go. I did pray a lot, you heard it.

Thank you for bringing her home safe, her kids are safe now too with their mother. Know that our love is not a fantasy its real. I can't wait to feel her and she will teach me to have You more in my heart. She started to not be so critique about you but accept you. I want and do if you give you me her. Sorry I want to make deal with you but I guess you know.

I want to make love with her and pray with her. Give me words to describe that to her. Don't leave me for I only have one wish!

Amen

========================================================================================

After reading private letter from Richard to Leanne:

First of all, I don't think Richard is the type of man who would hurt himself, I know because I have experienced it myself and it takes a lot of dark sadness and stupidness to really cut your wrists believe me.

I'm suprised that you say that he doesn't think you are doing your best because yesterday or the day before you told me that Richard thinks it is going better.

Leanne, I WILL come for you one day you know that. If I'm better and my life is on track again I will move mountains to come and get you. Its a promise I made to you, our love and to God.

I'm not sure what to do in the meantime, except that we talk about it as much as we can. Normally I'm a guy with all the answers. My hope is that we do it together, even in hard times.

-- do not send --
What did R mean when he talks about the kids and Leanne be happy for once?
-- do not send --

========================================================================================

My loving Eve

Turn my Scars into Stars; Hurts into Halos,
Tough times never last, but tough people do!
God loves you, and believe me; Oh! I do too!
Let thy hopes, not the hurts, shape endless future!
I was a lost wound, bound by temporarily suture,
Come for me! My true love; drag me over thy rainbows.

Worry about tomorrow; steal the joy from today,
Unconditional love so illogical, yet so strong!
How can it no be? Did You hear her fearless love song?
So look inside me, acknowledge this distanced love!
Give Your birdseye view a good thought from above!
Don't be scared Leanne; He will show me the way.

What you believe; is what you will achieve,
Yes, you are my dreamer, my love, my foundation!
From Genesis to Revelation, my hearts salvation!
My happiness, my light, my only sweet sensation!
The calm in my body, hearing your warm conversation,
Since you are in my life; God made you: My loving Eve.

========================================================================================

Dreaming of the Albatross

So longing and wanting my lover, I crashed on weepin' beach;
Where lovers sing lonely love tunes and burn sadness away;
There where I find you so close and still within dreamers reach;

As I entered my dreams a great Albatross came calm and so fair,
and a feather fell out of his chest, and I felt without delay!
This message from my love saying: 'wait my love, I will soon be there';

The bird took me on a trip over the tranquil blue lovers ocean;
And showed me the graves where unanswered love sleeps and decay;
Then he took me back to weepin' beach, surrounded by deep emotion;

In the morning I felt lonely, he was gone, as I suddenly went grey!
How could I have missed this! This was the dream I was always waiting for!
That bird was my lover Leanne, she lovingly touched me from far and away...

========================================================================================

God,

I don't have to tell you what I'm thinking. I was a little upset today by what Leanne told me, fight at home, that letter from Richard. It gave me lots to think about, as it always has been.

Oh what would I not give to sit around the table with both Leanne and Richard and talk face to face about the situation. In spite of it all I think there are valid options.

I really do feel Richards frustration, I had the same feelings when Leanne told me to go that Sunday. But, you can clearly see that the love between us is so good, I won't say better then between Richard and Leanne, but more deeply, more like love was supposed to be, more true.

I will do anything in my power to protect what Leanne and I have and I told her I will come for her when the day comes. Question is how to deal with that until that day has your blessing. I don't know the answer to be honest.

What I want? Its pretty selfish but hey you know I don't have much options and influence. I want Leanne to wait for me on your blessed day and I want that she is safe and secure in her present situation with Richard. And lets not forget her kids.

I know this is possible. I know because I still see your promise and gift. I do see the difficulties for Leanne so my real prayer for tonight and coming days is: please help her where I cannot; she is so dear to me I urge you to help her thru the days and nights. I never seen and felt such a pretty soul as Leanne. She is the world to me. I am even more sure that she loves me more then I love her.

Care for Levi for as I understand he has some problems that I will hope will be fixed. Kiss the benjamin for me for she is the sunshine of Canada and give Ariel the same qualities I see in Leanne as a woman later in life.

I thank you for giving me Leanne so we may walk with you together under your love and protection.

Amen.

========================================================================================

Dream

We were together and very happy, I think I was in Canada. When we had sex one night just before I came I say to you: pray you will be pregnant. Then later you was in the hospital and call me at home asking if I would like to know if boy or girl and I say ok. Then you came home with a present and saying that it was going to be boy. Then much later you gave birth and I call him Adam. That's it.

========================================================================================

Poem about language not so important



========================================================================================

God,

Thank you for this PERFECT day and talk with my Leanne. I know you see all that we do but we made love and that was so what we needed. We really talked today about difficult things without any difficulties towards each other. I told her we have been growing towards and that felt really good.

Tonight Leanne and Richard are going to some marriage counseling evening. Leanne told me not to worry, but you know me; I do. She does too.

Like five minutes ago we talked in Skype, man that was so great! I got to hear her voice and see her smile! That's like more important then food for me!

I told her not to worry for tonight I wanted to say that to her and I did. I also told her about my dream about we having a child. Make up your own mind about that I don't make up my own dreams although I would not mind.

Give Leanne the wisdom to cope with tonight and coming days and nights, I think she needs you more now then ever. Also help her husband Richard to find some kind of peace and understanding. He will never be my friend but I don't want him to hate me.

As always kiss benjamin: the spring of the north, don't lose Levi out of your care and teach Ariel to be a good woman as well.

If I had any doubt in the past about you and Leanne and me? That's gone. So thank you for that.

I love you and I love Leanne, tell her that too (I've told her a thousand times but hey, never enough)

Amen

========================================================================================

Ne me quitte jamais

	(every third line a short verse from the bible)


Our love is acknowledged by Lord and by Heaven,
too deep and too true and delicious to be riven;
For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone!
Let me show my cherished one, my scars resembles: "Leanne Hold On!"

God! You and your confusing verses took advantage of my weak foolish heart, and then!
Gave me hope where nothing else then sadness for me in your wicked cruel plan!
Behold, I will plead your case and take vengeance for you. --
	I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.
If this is my future, my prayer is short and brutally final: 
	"Dear God, I Welcome The Day I Decide To Die!"

Heaven don't leave her alone; Thoughts all mixed scared and jumbled!
It frightens me when I think of our lovely world we have build crumbled;
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, which feed among the lillies!
What to do? I'm so close! I fear the roundtable counseling cruel cannibalistic committees!

Like you said in your last video: "Olaf, Never Leave Me, Never!"
You know if this love dies, we will take the fall together;
You are all fair, my love, and there is no spot in you!
So why are you so distant? Strike another match, go start anew!

When walking I prayed and I gave it thought and concluded,
Our love and compassion can't be left; its too deeply rooted;
How fair and how pleasant you are, O love, with your delights!
Look at me, look at us, don't drown us in all those dark nights.

Remember our laughs, look deep in thy heart, choose the one you love the most,
Feel the damp grass as we lay down and I kiss you, where I hold you so close.
Come, my beloved, let us go forth to the field; let us lodge in the villages.
Come with me to fill in our colors of love on the collage of holy fake images.


My days are pleasently filled with her voice and her love, I feel her presence,
I dream our dreams and I'm glad that the center of my life is you in its essence.
Let your garments always be white, and let your head lack no oil.
Guess it was too much to ask, waking up next to you, on the land of Canada's soil.


I still have good hope, I can't leave her as she commands my deepest feeling,
That glorious day when I come for her will be the day I'd be kneeling;
To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven:
We belong together for you are the girl with an answer to my every lifes question.


I love you

========================================================================================

Sad Questions of a thousand dreams

Our love was an institute you cannot disparage,
why not choose love? But for a man in a loveless marriage?
"Don't leave me, never leave me", her voice in my head,
Our dream and my soul are broken; I feel so misled.

I cannot stop loving and neither can she,
So we both die unhappy surely that God must see?
I felt almost a husband and provider for her kids,
Ready to change my life for love and winning the bids.

Since I know her I never felt happier in my life,
No I face dark times alone without her as my wife,
Why is this misery again my only companion?
Only to find myself lonely, sick and abandoned?

For a decade I've been waiting for love and good luck,
I think this verse died now; my life will always suck.
Not only my body, soul and career are in bits 'n pieces,
For sure nobody knows that I'm bleeding like Jesus.

I should have known this was coming I was blind all along,
I'm not born for love! I have no part in this murdered lovesong!
With the loss of my loved one I threw away hope,
Why hope? Why care? When our compassion dangles on a rope?

I am stuck here with nothing, only a heartbreaking 'Why?',
I stare angry at the sky, what a lie, deny me let me die.
I have no further questions for myself, I'm empty as space,
I just want to fade away, alone, disappear without a trace.

========================================================================================

God,

You know I'm so sad, Leanne is letting me go as a wife and I have no other choice but to follow her decision. It broke my heart and I have been crying all day long.

Don't ask me to understand it because I really don't. Our love, and as a romantic, I know this was the best you must ever have seen. I promised myself I will always love Leanne and will never be in another relationship again. This was the greatest love of my life and I don't want to be hurt like this ever again.

I'm glad Leanne did not cut off all contact, I still need her I can't shut of my love and affection for her in a minute. I'm really having a hard time right now you know, I feel so alone and empty. I won't break my promise though, if I can I will collect my gift from you.

Be with Leanne, kiss her from me, let her always know I love her so much and miss her so much, for I will never loose her from my heart. Protect her lovely kids, I love them all.

Amen

========================================================================================

Endless spiral of love

No time exists when you enter the room;
that ravishing smile on your pretty little face;
Or walk outside, lilies spontaneously bloom;
You have the power to make sweet the dullest place.

So I leave my heart and arms always open;
And I'll wish for you and me and may pray;
Eyes focused on you, here's to hopin';
For your loving warm kiss and embrace everyday.

Your beauty: millions of diamonds sparkling in the sun;
Your voice: fresh like water, smooth as silk;
She in herself being a masterpiece of God's son;
Her body: so tender and a delightful color of coconut milk.

As your luscious red lips kiss mine we drowned in deep love;
Our minds and heart melted in cosmic cherry red velvet;
As I readily folded within the warm wings of my dove;
Where I am protected from all evil, shes my safety net; my helmet.

========================================================================================

She,
Beauty, smiling.
Lovely young woman.
I want to kiss,
Always.

Lost,
In space.
In the woods.
In thought, in translation?
Dutch.

Connection,
Between us.
Deep and true,
Seen there by God.
Good.

Hug's,
Warm, comforting.
Holding me tight,
Tears all gone now,
Safe.

Promise,
From God,
I will collect,
When time is there,
Patience.

Pastor Penniless

Pastor Penniless, a man of many years,
Preached this Sunday in empty church.
The people hated him speak in tears,
and left him all alone in the lurch.

Pastor Penniless,

20 feet velvet cloth

On top of the hill I found her; wrapped in 20 feet velvet cloth,
She could not move nor speak nor see nor think nor hear nor be with me.
I saw my task to unwrap this elf, before she turns into a antler moth,
and fly away where I can't go, and I'll be lonely under the Judas tree.

The first two feet of cloth and she was blind no more,
And she looked upon my trembling hands longing to touch.
I could see the love in those pretty big eyes; a open door,
I cried too my heart full but mind can only stand that much.

So I kept unwinding some more feet of cloth and she heard,
all my loving and music and poems I willingly declared.
I told her don't worry and whispered a four-letter word,
To calm us and she smiled to be ready and prepared.

I continued unwinding more cloth and then she finally spoke,
"Oh lover, oh lover there are you, I waited so long!".
Her words flew in the damp air like celestial smoke,
I could not answer her what I had terribly done wrong.

Boldly I unwrapped the last feet of cloth and she moved,
her body against mine, we talked, listened and laughed.
She was finally free from this prison, her smile approved,
And we rolled down the hill in Gods green valley of love.

========================================================================================

God,

I'm glad my parents came to visit me, emotional I'm still a wreck. Now and then I burst into tears. I guess, for the for the umpteenth time, am slowly accepting Leanne's choice, but boy do I feel heartbroken. Thinking of Leanne, playing a game with her and sometimes send a little text or pray or poem helps me change my mood to a more happy one, so that's good.

You know I still pray that one day I will see her. If that's wrong, then I guess I'm a bad person in your eyes, guess you prefer Richard. I think a lot about time, like in 100 years from now will you regret deny me the love I always wanted? Sometimes I wish I was a fish or some kind of other animal, unable to feel or give love, just live a short life and be done with it. I really don't see the point of all this complicated sad things you give us.

I watched the move 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' and read upon that story in the Bible. I could not find a nice verse for today to send Leanne, I will try that in the morning just before she goes to church.

Protect Leanne, make her happy and care for her beautiful children. If anything would happen to them in the future, don't do that but give me that pain, I'm in pain already. I want them safe.

Never let me leave her mind and heart Lord and don't let me lose her completely. I do feel a little better, happier and calmer everyday but I still need her, she is my only friend, she is an angel.

Amen

Reversed broken mirror (change me or delete this)

It was upon a Sommers shynie day,
When Titan faire his beames did display,
In a fresh fountaine, farre from all mens vew,
She bath'd her brest, the boyling heat t'allay;
She bath'd with roses red, and violets blew,
And all the sweetest flowres, that in the forrest grew.

His shiny surface reflects my dream,
And times and things, in that vision, seem,
She woke: the babble of the stream,
It was not me there in that funny light beam;
My wicked mind projects my love and my dream,
Its her, my love, my growing self esteem.

========================================================================================

God,

I did not feel that good today, its hard to be happy. I feel bad because I knew Leanne was trying to cheer me up and I completely ignored her. Please help me not to do that again, you know how much I like to text with her. Its so hard to see happiness.

I hope you gave Leanne and her kids a happy day though and make sure they are all fine and healthy. I feel like I'm losing even the will to be happy, almost nothing has my interest anymore, not even Seti radio or other things I liked. Guess I'm losing it and breaking apart.

I hope you will help me coming week, no therapy anymore, empty fridge almost and nothing to do. Give me inspiration at least to write some nice words and poems to Leanne.

Protect the ones I love, specially her. Thank you.

Amen

Heart Seasoning

All those herbs
She plucked by hand
Spoon by spoon
From Gods own land

Into a container
And stirred with swoop
Spoon of this and that
Right into taco soup

A kitchen Queen
My only cook book
My happy ingredient
My Captain Cook

With a paprika smile
She tells me how
To stir up my heart
Beloved, is it thou?

Onion n chili powder
My God this will stink
But hopefully a calling
When we kiss eat and drink

Cumin and garlic and love and some salt
Oh love I'm so hungry let eat today right away!
My lovin' spoon lady; still my great hunger
But never let love never halt, my cooking wonder

========================================================================================

As a writer I describe wars, query matters of households not worthy of words of the heart but when I walk and feel the sand where those lovers has walked before me my heart feels like a Portuguese man o' war, so sharp and venomous, my words are not for reading but killing; poor history.

As a spartan in a war where only books and legends survive, I met my enemy who asked me to kill him and take his wife, I spared him and send him away carrying my soul and sword; never to come back to these cold shores; my empty heard and bloody sword is punishment enough on his lonely journey to nowhere where only he will find a fire to warm his foolish heart; poor soul.

As a listener I'm deaf as a table without visitors, I seem to hear only the beat of my heart beating my body to sleep, my spleen, like the sea that beats and defies the sand on where I once walked and slept slips away into the unknown grey light of silence; poor heart.

As a student I learned to keep my ground and lay low for what man cares about the poison of greener pastures he does not possesses? I wish that I was as much separated from information and wisdom as a bird from the bottom of the ocean for what brings it but only reason, understanding, sorrow and tears for mankind, a species I'm not even familiar with; poor evolution.

As I watched inside myself I saw the shadows of long lost little angry angels who told me stories of finding love right under the sea level where temperature is like a high fever and happiness is waiting and I will always be alone accept when dolphins want to play with me; poor friends.

As a wave I travelled fare but never got anywhere, always on the run, migrating and hibernating, always cold with no wish to get any warmer wanted to be silence for years like my beloved Guru in the hope to find some peace for; poor people;

As a sailor I want to taste the salt of endless seas, never arrive nor see land with only the large birds as my silence friends showing me the sky where I want to find the sky and drink the last drops of moist that once started the light between my ancestors. Come wind, come hope, show me that land where I will never strand; poor life.

Again as a writer and a silly old man I have no history, no soul, no heart, no evolution, friends or life. I embrace only love, the inability to hold on and strive for a comfortable mind, still I see the empty table, the shadows and my flat friend: the sea, is not each life a short colorful dream? Let Medusa turn me into stone to never awake me; poor fantasy.

As a lover in love with the wind and with her I have only one destiny to where my heart goes, for the large birds will show me and never a table empty shall this love find his evolution as dinner or empty words, fantasy and heart and will be remembered in human history. People will know and learn what losing and finding love again really means; don't stop a man in love, Me!, in pursue of his dreams!

Day at the zoo

Today the day is finally Zoo Day,
All the kids are ready to know,
the sun is up; Lets Go! Lets Go!
And see the cute new baby eagle ray.

We saw the penguins eat lots of fish,
The baboons act crazy and made us laugh!
The kids are running and crazy, our wish,
we walked and lookup up at the mighty giraffe.

The hippo farted and had so much fun,
Wolfs howled, birds chirped, the lion roared,
The youngest played in the chicken run,
As we sat down an watched the spotted deer horde.

Then it was time for a fresh cold icecream,
Tigers with cups and the peacock showed off,
the boy facinated by the freshwater bream,
The tigers all fighting and acting so tough.

Time flies when having fun, euphoria!
Girls making faces to the baboon fearing the snakes,
the boy plays wolf boy, mom in awe of the Sauria,
Time to go home for barbecued T-bone steaks ;-)



========================================================================================

God,

Please make Leanne feel better. She has been working really hard and not much sleep last night. Also make her kids feel better, for I understand they have been feeling little sick lately.

Thank you for today, it was a good one for me and I felt really relaxed. I wish this feeling for tomorrow too. 

Please let her know I'm doing better and she is still in my heart with all the love I have and that we still talk, I'm very thankful for that. My appetite is coming back and that also make me feel better.

Today was a beautiful day here, give Leanne also some extra sunshine because she likes that very much, I guess she is a little tired of the cold.

Give her a good rest tonight so she feels better tomorrow. Give her a nice dream and while your at it give me one too.

Thank you.

Amen


========================================================================================

God,

Although I had a pretty good and relax day I still missed Leanne very much. Also because she didn't feel very good today, make her feel better. For some reason I can't seem to find words to write a poem for her, guess I'm a little scared to write for I think it will not be so nice, you know I only want to write about love. Maybe tomorrow I will, I like fridays.

I'm glad her kids are a little better and can go to school again to discover and learn. Today I had myself a freelance job for 4 hours, that was strange but nice. 

Make sure the Tiger balm works extra good for her, be with her as she sleeps and dreams and tell her I love her and miss her. Make a good day for her tomorrow, she deserves it more then I do.

אלוהים שלי , אני אוהב אותה כל כך

Thank you.

Amen
